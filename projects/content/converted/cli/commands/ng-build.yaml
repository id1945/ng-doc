      ng build [project] [--[option]=[value]]

      ng b

      ```


      Compiles an Angular app into an output directory named `dist/` at the given output path. Must be executed from within a workspace directory.


      Alias for the command:
       
      ```

      ng run [project]:build

      ```


      `[project]` â€” the name of the project to build.


      ---


      By default for applications CLI uses builder [`browser`](../builder-browser). And `@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr:build` for libraries.


      A builder runs with default configuration options specified in the workspace configuration file (`angular.json`) or with a named alternative configuration.


      The configuration options generally correspond to the command options.

      You can override individual configuration defaults by specifying the corresponding options on the command line.

      The command can accept option names given in either dash-case or camelCase.

      Note that in the configuration file, you must specify names in camelCase.


      Some additional options can only be set through the configuration file,

      either by direct editing or with the `ng config` command.

      Alias for the command:


      ```

      ng run [default-project]:build:production

      ```


      By default, the production target is set up in the workspace configuration such that all builds make use of bundling, limited tree-shaking, and also limited dead code elimination.

      option defaults for that target. Setting this explicitly overrides the
      `--prod` flag.
