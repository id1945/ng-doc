      Angular CLI version 6 changed a format of configuration file and
      introduced builders.


      In `angular.json` you can define different ways to build/serve of your application.


      For running builds use the command [`ng run`](../command-ng-run).


      As schematics, builders are installed via package manager (npm). This section describes the default Angular builders from package `@angular-devkit/build-angular`.
