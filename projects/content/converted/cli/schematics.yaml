      Schematics is a workflow tool for the modern web; it can apply transforms
      to your project, such as create a new component, or updating your code to
      fix breaking changes in a dependency. Or maybe you want to add a new
      configuration option or framework to an existing project.


      In Angular CLI you can run schematics by [`ng generate`](../command-ng-generate).


      Also [`ng add`](../command-ng-add) uses Schematics.
