      When building with the CLI, you must configure the `angular.json` to
      include all external assets, including external style files.


      Register global style files in the `styles` section which, by default, is pre-configured with the global `styles.css` file.


      You can add more global styles via the `styles` option inside your project's build target options in `angular.json`. These will be loaded exactly as if you had added them in a `<link>` tag inside `index.html`.


      ```

      "architect": {
        "build": {
          "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser",
          "options": {
            "styles": [
              "src/styles.css",
              "src/more-styles.css",
            ],
            ...
      ```


      You can also rename the output and lazy load it by using the object format:


      ```

      "styles": [
        "src/styles.css",
        "src/more-styles.css",
        { "input": "src/lazy-style.scss", "lazy": true },
        { "input": "src/pre-rename-style.scss", "bundleName": "renamed-style" },
      ],

      ```
