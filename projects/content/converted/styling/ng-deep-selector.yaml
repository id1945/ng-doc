      Component styles normally apply only to the HTML in the component's own
      template.


      Use the `::ng-deep` shadow-piercing descendant combinator to force a style down through the child component tree into all the child component views. The `::ng-deep` combinator works to any depth of nested components, and it applies to both the view children and content children of the component.


      The following example targets all `<h3>` elements, from the host element down through this component to all of its child elements in the DOM.

  - type: text
    text: The `::ng-deep` combinator also has the aliases `>>>`, and `/deep/`.
  - type: text
    text: Use `/deep/`, `>>>` and `::ng-deep` only with `emulated` view
      encapsulation. Emulated is the default and most commonly used view
      encapsulation. For more information, see the [view encapsulation
      section](../encapsulation).
  - type: text
    text: The shadow-piercing descendant combinator is deprecated and support is
      being removed from major browsers and tools. As such we plan to drop
      support in Angular (for all 3 of `/deep/`, `>>>` and `::ng-deep`). Until
      then `::ng-deep` should be preferred for a broader compatibility with the
      tools.
