      Lets you link to specific routes in your app.


      Consider the following route configuration:


      `[{ path: 'user/:name', component: UserCmp }]`.


      When linking to this `user/:name` route, you use the `RouterLink` directive.


      If the link is **static**, you can use the directive as follows:


      `<a routerLink="/user/bob">link to user component</a>`



      If you use **dynamic** values to generate the link, you can pass an array of path segments, followed by the params for each segment.


      For instance `['/team', teamId, 'user', userName, {details: true}]` means that we want to generate a link to `/team/11/user/bob;details=true`.
  - type: text
    text: >-
      Multiple static segments can be merged into one (e.g., `['/team/11/user',
      userName, {details: true}]`).


      The first segment name can be prepended with `/`, `./`, or `../`:

      * If the first segment begins with `/`, the router will look up the route from the root of the app.

      * If the first segment begins with `./`, or doesn't begin with a slash, the router will instead look in the children of the current activated route.

      * And if the first segment begins with `../`, the router will go up one level.

      You can set query params and fragment as follows:


      ```

      <a [routerLink]="['/user/bob']" [queryParams]="{debug: true}" fragment="education">
        link to user component
      </a>

      ```


      RouterLink will use these to generate this link: `/user/bob#education?debug=true`.


      You can also tell the directive to preserve the current query params and fragment:


      ```

      <a [routerLink]="['/user/bob']" [queryParams]="{debug: true}" queryParamsHandling="merge">
        link to user component
      </a>

      ```


      You can tell the directive to how to handle queryParams, available options are:
       - `'merge'`: merge the queryParams into the current queryParams
       - `'preserve'`: preserve the current queryParams
       - default/`''`: use the queryParams only
  - type: text

      The router link directive always treats the provided input as a delta to
      the current url.


      For instance, if the current url is `/user/(box//aux:team)`.


      Then the following link `<a [routerLink]="['/user/jim']">Jim</a>` will generate the link

      `/user/(jim//aux:team)`.
