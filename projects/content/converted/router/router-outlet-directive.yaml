      Acts as a placeholder that Angular dynamically fills based on the current
      router state.


      ```

      <router-outlet></router-outlet>

      <router-outlet name='left'></router-outlet>

      <router-outlet name='right'></router-outlet>

      ```


      A router outlet will emit an activate event any time a new component is being instantiated,

      and a deactivate event when it is being destroyed.


      ```

      <router-outlet
        (activate)='onActivate($event)'
        (deactivate)='onDeactivate($event)'></router-outlet>
      ```
