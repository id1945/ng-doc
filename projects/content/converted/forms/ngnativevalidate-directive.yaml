      Angular adds `novalidate` attribute to all forms by default, `novalidate`
      is used to disable browser's native form validation.


      If you want to use native validation with Angular forms, just add `ngNativeValidate` attribute:


      ```

      <form ngNativeValidate></form>

      ```
