      The Angular safe navigation operator (`?.`) is a fluent and convenient way
      to guard against `null` and `undefined` values in property paths. 


      Here it is, protecting against a view render failure if the `currentHero` is null:


      ```html

      The current hero's name is {{currentHero?.name}}

      ```


      It works perfectly with long property paths:


      ```html

      The current hero's name is {{currentHero?.info?.name}}

      ```


      And methods:


      ```html

      The current hero's name is {{currentHero?.getInfo()?.name}}

      ```
