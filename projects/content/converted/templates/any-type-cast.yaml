      Sometimes a binding expression will be reported as a type error and it is
      not possible or difficult to fully specify the type. To silence the error,
      you can use the `$any` cast function to cast the expression to the `any`
      type.


      ```html

      <!-- Accessing an undeclared member -->

      <div>
        The hero's marker is {{$any(hero).marker}}
      </div>

      ```


      The $any cast function can be used in conjunction with this to allow access to undeclared members of the component.


      ```html

      <!-- Accessing an undeclared member -->

      <div>
        Undeclared members is {{$any(this).member}}
      </div>

      ```
