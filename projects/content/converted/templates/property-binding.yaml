      Write a template property binding to set a property of a view element. The
      binding sets the property to the value of a template expression.


      The most common property binding sets an element property to a component property value:
  - type: text
    text: |-
      ```typescript
      <img [src]="imageUrl" style="height:150px">
      ```
    source: "\n"
  - type: text
    text: "Another is setting a property of a directive:"
  - type: text
    text: |
      ```html
      <div [ngClass]="classes">
        [ngClass] binding to the classes property
      </div>
      ```

    text: |-
      ```html
      <user-panel [name]="userName"></user-panel>
      ```

      ```
