      You write these template expressions in a language that looks like
      JavaScript. Many JavaScript expressions are legal template expressions,
      but not all.


      JavaScript expressions that have or promote side effects are prohibited, including:

        * assignments (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, ...)
        * `new`
        * chaining expressions with `;` or `,`
        * increment and decrement operators (`++` and `--`)

      Other notable differences from JavaScript syntax include:

        * no support for the bitwise operators `|` and `&`
        * new template expression operators, such as `|`, `?.` and `!`.
