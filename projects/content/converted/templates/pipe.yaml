      The result of an expression might require some transformation before
      you're ready to use it in a binding.


      Angular pipes are a good choice for small transformations such as these. Pipes are simple functions that accept an input value and return a transformed value. They're easy to apply within template expressions, using the pipe operator (|):
  - type: text
    text: |-
      ```html
      Title through uppercase pipe: 
      {{title | uppercase}}
      ```
  - type: text
    text: "You can chain expressions through multiple pipes:"
  - type: text
    text: |-
      ```html
      Title through a pipe chain:
      {{title | uppercase | lowercase}}
      ```
  - type: text
    text: "And you can also apply parameters to a pipe:"
  - type: text
    text: |-
      ```html
      Birthdate: 
      {{currentHero?.birthdate | date:'longDate'}}
      ```
