      A callback method that performs change-detection, invoked after the
      default change-detector runs.


      The default change-detection algorithm looks for differences by comparing bound-property values by reference across change detection runs. You can use this hook to check for and respond to changes by some other means.


      When the default change detector detects changes, it invokes `ngOnChanges()` if supplied, regardless of whether you perform additional change detection. Typically, you should not use both `DoCheck` and `OnChanges` to respond to changes on the same input.
