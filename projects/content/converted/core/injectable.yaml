    text: The `@Injectable` decorator identifies services and other classes that are
      intended to be injected. It can also be used to configure a provider for
      those services.

      #### Example

      ```typescript
      import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

      @Injectable()
      export class MyService {
        constructor() { }
      }
      ```
  - type: text
    text: "## Options"
  - type: interface-option
    head: providedIn
    description: Tells Angular that the root injector is responsible for creating an
      instance of the service (by invoking its constructor) and making it
      available across the application.
    name: providedIn
    headId: providedIn
    interface: "providedIn?: Type<any>|'root'|'platform'|'any'|null"
    showAdditional: true
    additional: Sometimes it's not desirable to have a service always be provided in
      the application root injector. Perhaps users should explicitly opt-in to
      using the service, or the service should be provided in a lazily-loaded
      context. In this case, the provider should be associated with a specific
      `@NgModule` class, and will be used by whichever injector includes that
      module.
