  ng n
short: Creates a new angular application.
full: |
  Creates and initializes a new Angular app that is the default project for a new workspace.

  Provides interactive prompts for optional configuration, such as adding routing support. All prompts can safely be allowed to default.

  If you plan to have multiple apps in the workspace, you can create an empty workspace by setting the `--createApplication` option to false.
  You can then use `ng generate application` to create an initial app. This allows a workspace name different from the initial app name,
  and ensures that all apps reside in the `/projects` subfolder, matching the structure of the configuration file.
